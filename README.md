The rule engine you always deserved.

RulePipe is a declarative, scalable, highly configurable rule engine. Usage areas include, but not limited to;

- Classification
- Filtering
- Triggering other tasks
- User-driven flow implementations
- Event based checks
- Domain specific complex rule inputs

## Installation

RulePipe uses some Python package as a module. These packages must be installed during installation.

### Run RulePipe REST API Service

- Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/emregeldegul/rulepipe.git`
- Change directory to repository directory `cd rulepipe`
- Install the necessary packages `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Rename the .env.example file to .env `mv .env.example .env`
- Change the database settings in the .env file.
- Run flask service `export FLASK_APP=api.py && python3 -m flask run`

Is enough for installing and using RulePile as a RESTful service.

### Test the Service

If you have successfully installed and runned RulePipe, now you can use it as a
rule engine service.

To add a simple rule to your engine:

~~~sh
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '
  {
    "type": "rule",
    "match": "all",
    "rules": [
      {
        "field": "responseTimeInSeconds",
        "condition": "lte",
        "value": 3.45
      },
      {
        "field": "statusCode",
        "condition": "gte",
        "value": 200
      }
    ]
  }
  ' http://localhost:5000/add_rule/myNewRule
~~~

In this rule screnario, if `"responseTimeInSeconds"` value is less than or
equal to 3.45 and `"statusCode"` value is greater than or equal to 200 ,
input statement going to return `True` else return `False`.
(because `"Match"` is `"all"`, it returns `True` if all the conditions are `True`)

When you run make this request, if everything is OK, result is `"OK"`.

---

To check a simple statement:

~~~sh
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '
  {
    "responseTimeInSeconds": 2,
    "statusCode": 200
  }
  ' http://localhost:5000/execute_rule/myNewRule
~~~

This statement is provides the conditions of our rule, so its result should be:
`{"response":true}` with `200` return code.

If we check another statement as below:

~~~sh
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '
  {
    "responseTimeInSeconds": 5,
    "statusCode": 404
  }
  ' http://localhost:5000/execute_rule/myNewRule
~~~

Although 404 is greather than 200, because of 5 is greater than 3.45
our condition is not providing the condition of our rule. So its result should
be as:
`{"response":false}` with `200` return code.

## RoadMap

In Progress:


To Do:

- [ ] Support defining custom conditions
- [ ] Support predefined actions
- [ ] Support defining custom actions
- [ ] Support for OpenTracing
- [ ] Dockerize and prepare Docker Compose file

Completed:

- [x] Add REST API
- [x] Add persistent DB (maybe MongoDB)
- [x] Add cache for rules (maybe Redis)
- [x] Add cache for statement return values
- [x] Add webhooks for Telegram to track progress
- [x] Add logging and use log levels
- [x] Read database information from config file and environment variables
- [x] Support subfields in JSON (probably needs dot notation)
- [x] Support nested rules
- [x] Make caching optional
- [x] Set hash of data as Redis keys
- [x] Enable precedence in environment variables
